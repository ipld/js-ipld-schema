# schema-schema: `AdvancedDataLayoutName`

AdvancedDataLayoutName defines the name of an ADL as a string.

The same constraints and conventions apply as for TypeName.

This identifier is used for keys in the AdvancedDataLayoutMap and also as
references to ADLs where the "advanced" representation strategy is used for
the types that support it.
